Unemployment Analysis Using Data Science

Overview

The Unemployment Analysis Using Data Science project aims to analyze and visualize unemployment data to provide insights into unemployment trends and factors. This project leverages data science techniques to explore and understand unemployment patterns, correlations, and predictions.

Features

Data Import: Loads and preprocesses unemployment data from various sources.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Provides statistical summaries and visualizations to understand data distributions and relationships.
Data Visualization: Utilizes charts and graphs to visualize unemployment trends and patterns.
Predictive Modeling: Builds and evaluates models to predict unemployment rates based on various features.
Reporting: Generates comprehensive reports on findings and insights from the analysis.
Installation

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed:

Python 3.x
Required Python libraries (listed in requirements.txt)
Setup

Clone the Repository


 code
git clone https://github.com/Rohan3177/unemployment-analysis-using-data-science.git
Navigate to the Project Directory

code
cd unemployment-analysis-using-data-science
Install Required Libraries

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and install the dependencies:

code
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure the Application

If applicable, configure the application by editing the config.yaml file or environment variables.

Run the Analysis

To execute the analysis and generate results, run:

code
python analysis.py
The results will be saved to the results/ directory or displayed in the console, depending on your configuration.

Usage

Load Data

Place your unemployment data files in the data/ directory. Ensure they are in the required format (e.g., CSV).

Run Analysis

Execute the analysis.py script to start the analysis. You can modify this script to change parameters or data sources as needed.

View Results

Results and visualizations will be saved in the results/ directory or displayed as specified in the script. Review the generated reports and charts to gain insights into unemployment trends.

Modify and Extend

You can customize the analysis by modifying the code in analysis.py, adding new data sources, or extending the visualizations and models.

File Structure

analysis.py: Main script for data analysis and model training.
requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies.
config.yaml: Configuration file for data sources and analysis parameters.
data/: Directory containing raw data files.
results/: Directory for saving analysis results and visualizations.
